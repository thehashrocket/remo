  <h2>What is Mozilla Reps?</h2>

  <h2>Do I get paid for being a Mozilla Rep?</h2>

  <p>The Mozilla Reps program is 100% volunteer based. Just like
  other functional areas of the Mozilla project, the support and
  energy of people all around the world is the backbone of Mozilla's
  open source model. While Mozilla does not offer paid positions for
  participating in the program, the Mozilla Reps program does
  provide specific tools and unique access to people and resources
  (including funding) that you won’t find anywhere else.</p>

  <h2>Where can I find and get in touch with other Mozilla Reps?</h2>

  <p>All Mozilla Reps have a profile page on the Mozilla Reps
  website and each page is listed on the Mozilla Rep
  website <a href="https://reps.mozilla.org/people/">people
  page</a>.</p>

  <h2>How can I get Mozilla swag?</h2>

  <p>Mozilla Reps have access to a special Swag Request form for
  events they are organizing or attending. Each request is reviewed
  and approved or rejected by the Review Team, based on a
  specific set of criteria. Mozilla Reps can also request Mozilla
  Rep-specific swag such as t-shirts, stickers and buttons that they
  are strongly encouraged to wear when attending events.</p>

  <h2>Can I produce my own localized swag?</h2>

  <p>Mozilla Reps will soon have access to a special tool that enables
  them to customize a specific set of swag and download the designs in
  PDF format for local production. All the designs have to follow
  Mozilla <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/foundation/trademarks/">trademark
  policy</a>
  and <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/styleguide/">brand
  guidelines</a>.</p>

  <h2>Can I request and manage my own budget for an event?</h2>

  <p>Mozilla Reps have access to a special Budget Request form for
  events they are organizing or attending, or for reimbursement for
  any events for which they had a budget approved. Each request is
  reviewed and approved or rejected by the Review Team,
  based on a specific set of criteria.</p>

  <h2>Who runs Mozilla Reps and how is the program organized?</h2>

  <p>The Mozilla Reps program is a community-driven program. Both
  Mozilla Reps themselves and Mozilla staff oversee and run the
  program, and plan to continuously improve it. For more information
  on the organizational structure and governance of the program,
  click <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/ReMo/Structure_Governance">here</a>.</p>

  <h2>If a Mozillian is already contributing to a specific area of
  the Mozilla project can that Mozillian also be a Mozilla Rep?</h2>

  <p>Yes, absolutely! In fact, most Mozilla Reps are veteran Mozilla
  contributors who have been promoting the project for a long
  time. Of course, becoming a Mozilla Rep might in some cases
  require them to spend less time contributing to these projects,
  but that will quickly be offset by all the new contributors that
  Mozilla Reps will be recruiting to work on those projects :)</p>

  <h2>Is the Mozilla Reps program aimed at replacing existing community efforts?</h2>

  <p>No, absolutely not. Mozilla Reps is designed precisely to
  strengthen existing community efforts by providing tools and
  resources to help push responsibility and authority to Mozillians
  and help them support their communities better.</p>

  <h2>Can there be several Mozilla Reps in the same country or locale?</h2>

  <p>Yes, there is no limit to the number of Mozilla Reps in a particular
  geographic location.</p>
