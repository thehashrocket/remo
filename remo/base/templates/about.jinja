    <h1>About Mozilla Reps</h1>
    <p>Community is the backbone of the Mozilla project. As the
    Mozilla project grows in scope and scale, community needs to be
    strengthened and empowered accordingly. This is the central aim of
    the Mozilla Reps program: to empower and to help push
    responsibility to the edges in order to help the Mozilla
    contributor base grow.</p>
    <p>The Mozilla Reps program provides a framework and
    specific tools to help volunteer Mozillians become official
    representatives of Mozilla in their region. Anyone 18 or older who is
    passionate and knowledgeable about Mozilla and who is ready to
    dive deeper into mobilizing communities can sign-up to the program. The
    Mozilla Reps program helps push responsibility and authority
    further outwards, to more Mozillians, making it much easier for
    volunteers to organize and/or attend events, recruit and mentor new
    contributors, and better support their local communities.</p>
    <p>When joining the program, a Mozilla Rep agrees to take on the
    following responsibilities:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>represent Mozilla in their country/region</li>
      <li>promote the Mozilla Project and our mission</li>
      <li>build on and support existing/future local community efforts and programs</li>
      <li>inspire, recruit and support new contributors</li>
      <li>support and mentor future Mozilla Reps</li>
      <li>document clearly all his/her activities</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can find more about joining the program on the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/ReMo/SOPs/Joining">Wiki</a></p>
    <h4>An open and community-driven program</h4>
    <p>The Mozilla Reps program is open to anyone 18 or older who is:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>passionate about the Mozilla Project</li>
      <li>knowledgeable of the Mozilla organization, its mission, its
      products and its community</li>
      <li>willing to communicate to as many people as possible and
      keen to inspire people to contribute to Mozilla</li>
      <li>keen to mobilize their fellow community members towards impactful contribution areas</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Although anyone can sign-up to become a Mozilla Rep, that
    doesn't mean you automatically become a Mozilla Rep after
    submitting your application. Because Mozilla Reps are entrusted
    with new responsibilities and special tools to speak on Mozilla's
    behalf, to manage budgets, events and swag, each application is
    carefully reviewed by the Mozilla Rep Council.</p>
